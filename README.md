# Simple Router

This is a simple client-side router built with plain JavaScript. It supports basic hash-based routing, dynamic routes with parameters, 404 handling, and browser history management.

## Features:
- Navigate between different views using URL hash (`#home`, `#about`, etc.).
- Handle dynamic routes like `/user/:id` (e.g., `#user/123`).
- Gracefully handle undefined routes with a 404 page.
- Support browser history navigation (back/forward) using the `History API`.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Use the links in the navigation bar to navigate between different routes.
